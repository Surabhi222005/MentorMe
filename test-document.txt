JavaScript Fundamentals

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.

Key Concepts:

1. Variables and Data Types
- Variables are containers for storing data values
- JavaScript has several data types: String, Number, Boolean, Object, Array, Null, Undefined
- Use 'let', 'const', or 'var' to declare variables

2. Functions
- Functions are reusable blocks of code
- They can take parameters and return values
- Function declarations and expressions are two ways to create functions

3. Control Flow
- Conditional statements (if/else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- These control how your program executes

4. Objects and Arrays
- Objects store key-value pairs
- Arrays store ordered collections of data
- Both are fundamental data structures in JavaScript

5. DOM Manipulation
- JavaScript can change HTML content, styles, and attributes
- Event handling allows for interactive web pages
- AJAX enables asynchronous data loading

Best Practices:
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment your code
- Follow consistent formatting
- Handle errors appropriately
- Test your code thoroughly

JavaScript is essential for modern web development and is used in both frontend and backend development through Node.js.
