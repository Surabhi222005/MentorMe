# Groq API Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Groq API for the MentorMe application.

## What is Groq?

Groq is an AI inference platform that provides ultra-fast responses using state-of-the-art language models. It's known for:
- **Speed**: Sub-second response times
- **Cost-effectiveness**: More affordable than many alternatives
- **Quality**: Powered by Meta's Llama3 and other high-quality models
- **Reliability**: Enterprise-grade infrastructure

## Step 1: Create a Groq Account

1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Get Started"
3. Complete the registration process
4. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Log in to your Groq Console
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" section
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "MentorMe Development")
5. Copy the generated API key (it starts with `gsk_`)

## Step 3: Configure Your Environment

1. In your MentorMe project, navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file and add your Groq API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_api_key_here
   PORT=5000
   ```

## Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test the health endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
   ```

   You should see a response like:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "OK",
     "message": "MentorMe backend is running",
     "provider": "Groq",
     "model": "llama3-8b-8192"
   }
